The Image Slider Website is straightforward to use. After installation, you can add your images to the slider by placing them in the `image` directory and updating the image paths in `index.html`.

### Adding Images
1. Place your image files in the `image` directory.
2. Open `index.html` and locate the image slider section:
    ```html
    <div class="carousel">
        <!-- list item -->
        <div class="list">
            <div class="item">
                <img src="image/image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
                <!-- Add more images here -->
            </div>
        </div>
        <!-- list thumnail -->
        <div class="thumbnail">
             <div class="item">
                <img src="image/image1.jpg" alt="Image 1">
                <!-- Add more images here -->
            </div>
        </div>
    </div>
    ```
3. Add or remove `<img>` tags as needed, ensuring the `src` attribute points to the correct file paths.

```javascript
    thumbnailBorderDom.appendChild(thumbnailItemsDom[0]);
